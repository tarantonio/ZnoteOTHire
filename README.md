ZnoteAAC for OTHire
========

original ZnoteAAC repository [GitHub](https://github.com/Znote/ZnoteAAC)

Based in ZnoteAAC 1.5 from 24/07/2014

This version is converted to work with OTHire [GitHub](https://github.com/TwistedScorpio/OTHire)

Was tested with OTHire 0.0.2 compiled with `__OLD_GUILD_SYSTEM__`

* Did NOT tested anything related to shop, nor item market
* There isn't `name` in `accounts` table, changed everything that calls for `name` to call `id` instead
* Handle Kills as TFS_03
* Handle Group_id as TFS_03 (no `type` in `account` tables)
* Displaying premium days at account properly now, fucking `$user_data['premend']` now working. THX ZNOTE
* Changes regarding `guilds` (`creationdata` -> `creationdate`; `ownerid` -> `owner_id`)
* Others thing handled as default or TFS_02
* Handle Houses as TFS_10 (`town_id` as `townid` and `size` as `tiles` added some shit through connect.php) (??auction thing should bug without balance system??)
* Added some tables to .../engine/database/connection.php to force compatibility
